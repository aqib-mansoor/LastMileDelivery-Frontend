# Last Mile Delivery System   - Frontend (React + Vite)
  

A smarter, faster, and more convenient way to get **everything delivered**—whether it’s food, groceries, medicines, or even personal packages.  

This project is built with **React + Vite** for the frontend and **Laravel (PHP) + MySQL** for the backend, ensuring a clean, scalable, and efficient architecture.

## 🚨 The Problem  

Existing delivery apps create challenges for all stakeholders:  

- **Customers** juggle multiple apps (food, grocery, parcels) and struggle with one-time delivery needs like sending documents or gifts.  
- **Vendors** without websites can’t sell online, and those who do have websites often fail to get enough orders.  
- **Riders** lose around **30% of their earnings** because they’re tied to single vendors instead of having flexible earning opportunities.
